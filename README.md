# **Password Generator Script**

This is a Python-based password generator script that allows you to create strong, secure passwords for various applications. You can specify the title of the thing (e.g., email, bank account) for which you need a password and provide a hint. The script will then generate a password based on the provided input and save it in a text file along with the date and time of creation.

## Features:
- **Custom Title**: You can give the password a title (e.g., Email, Bank Account).
- **Password Hint**: You can provide a hint for the password, which the script will use to generate a secure password.
- **Strong Password**: It combines random characters (letters, digits, punctuation) with the provided hint to generate a strong password.
- **Save to File**: The password, along with the title and the current date/time, is saved to a text file. 
- **Custom Save Path**: You can customize the path where the text file will be saved.

## **How to Use**

### Step 1: Set up the Script

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required packages (if any) by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(If there’s no requirements.txt file, it means no external dependencies are required.)*

3. Open the script `password_generator.py` in any text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).

### Step 2: Customize the Save Path

1. In the script, you’ll see a part of the code where the password text file is saved:

   ```python
   # Save the file in the current directory by default
   file_name = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), file_name)
   ```

2. You can change `os.getcwd()` to any directory where you want to save the text file. For example, if you want to save the file to `F:\Password Gen`, you can update this line:

   ```python
   file_name = os.path.join("F:\\Password Gen", file_name)
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Script

1. After customizing the path, you can run the script in your terminal or command prompt by navigating to the folder where the script is located and typing:

   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```

2. The script will prompt you to enter:
   - The **title** of the thing for which you need a password (e.g., "Email" or "Bank Account").
   - A **hint** text to help generate the password.

3. The script will then generate a strong password, display it on the screen, and save it to a text file with the name based on the title (e.g., `Email_password.txt`).

## **Example Output**

If you enter:
- **Title**: `Email`
- **Hint**: `myemailaccount`

The script will output something like:

```text
Your strong password for Email is: X9a@1Kz3!B
The password has been saved to 'F:\Password Gen\Email_password.txt'
```

The content of `Email_password.txt` will be:

```text
Thing: Email
Password: X9a@1Kz3!B
Generated on: 2025-01-29 14:45:32
```

## **Important Notes**

- The script generates strong passwords by combining your input with random characters and shuffling them.
- Make sure to adjust the **save path** before running the script to ensure that your passwords are saved in the desired folder.
- The password text file will include the **date and time** the password was generated, along with the title and the generated password.
